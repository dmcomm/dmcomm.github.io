## Field mapping

* Packet 1

  * 4 bits: Slot inverted
  * 4 bits: Enhancement
  * 4 bits: Slot
* Packet 2
  * 4 bits: Version inverted
  * 4 bits: Outcome inverted
  * 4 bits: Version
  * 4 bits: Outcome

Much of the above is already documented so I'm not currently repeating it.

## Original V-Pet

* Slot 3-14 depending on growth chart position.
* Enhancement normally 0-4, but 0-2 on the Weak English V1. See [here](/vpet/) for details.
* Version 0 for V1, 1 for V2 ... 4 for V5. Except, if a V1 is going second in the communication, it echoes what its opponent said.

## Original Pendulum

Slot 14 (3rd Perfect), Enhancement 7, Version 15, regardless of what Digimon is on the Pendulum. This is rather unbalanced and they stomp everything else. This device can only go second in the communication when using this battle system.

## Agumon/Patamon talking battler

Slot 3 (1st Child), Enhancement 7, version 15. This device can only go second in the communication when using this battle system.

## US D-Terminal

Slot 3 (1st Child), Version 13 (maybe they picked "D" on purpose). Enhancement ranges from 0-4 and is equal to the "V.S.ENEGY" shown. This device can only go second in the communication.
