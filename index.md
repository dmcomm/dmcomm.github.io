## Guides

* [A-Com with Arduino Nano](/guide/nano/) - the classic build used by the 0NL1NE community.
* [Pi Pico](/guide/pi-pico/) - experimental build using Raspberry Pi Pico to communicate with pronged and infrared devices.

## General info

* [Original V-Pet](/vpet/) - quirks and version discrepancies on the original Digital Monster (aka DMOG).

## Pronged protocols

* [Electrical](/electrical/) - how pronged communication happens at the physical level.
* [Original battles](/orig_battle/) - some brief information about the original battle protocol (still used as "Other Battle" on modern devices).
* [Xros Wars Mini](/xros_mini/) - protocol documentation.

## Infrared protocols

* [irplot](/irplot/) - interactive plots of various IR communication.

## External projects

* [0NL1NE Discord](https://discord.gg/znkvcMV) - for discussion of these topics, and help with anything on this site.
* [Alpha Project](https://www.alphahub.site/) - VPet Interfacing Eco-System.
* [ACom Wiki for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mintmaker.acomwiki) - app to communicate with these devices from your phone.
